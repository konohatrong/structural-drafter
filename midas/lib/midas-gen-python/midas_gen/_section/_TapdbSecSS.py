    """Tapered user-defined standard section for MIDAS GEN NX.

    Represents a tapered section whose cross-section varies linearly from the
    I-end (start) to the J-end (end) of a frame element. The shape type and
    dimension parameters are shared across both ends; only the sizes differ.

    Supported shapes (``Shape`` argument):
        - ``'SB'`` : Solid rectangle — params ``[H, B]``
        - ``'L'``  : Angle (L-section) — params ``[H, B, tw, tf]``
        - ``'C'``  : Channel — params ``[H, B1, tw, tf1, B2, tf2]``
        - ``'H'``  : H-beam / I-beam — params ``[H, B1, tw, tf1, B2, tf2, r1, r2]``
        - ``'T'``  : T-section — params ``[H, B, tw, tf]``
        - ``'B'``  : Box section — params ``[H, B, tw, tf1, C, tf2]``
        - ``'P'``  : Pipe (hollow circle) — params ``[D, tw]``

    Attributes:
        ID (int): Section database ID assigned by MIDAS.
        NAME (str): Section name.
        TYPE (str): Always ``'TAPERED'``.
        SHAPE (str): Shape code (see above).
        PARAMS_I (list[float]): Dimension parameters at the I-end.
        PARAMS_J (list[float]): Dimension parameters at the J-end.
        OFFSET (Offset): Cross-section offset configuration.
        USESHEAR (bool): Whether to include shear deformation.
        USE7DOF (bool): Whether to include warping (7th DOF) effect.
        DATATYPE (int): Internal MIDAS data-type identifier (always ``2``).
